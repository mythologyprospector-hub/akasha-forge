# Akasha Forge

The construction engine of the Akasha ecosystem.

Akasha Forge is responsible for transforming approved ideas, discoveries, and system needs into structured tools, repositories, and modules. Where Akasha Discovery explores unknowns, Forge builds the instruments required to investigate them.

Forge does not decide what should exist. It builds what the system determines is needed.

---

## Purpose

Akasha Forge provides:

• repository scaffolding  
• tool and module generation  
• documentation templates  
• structural alignment with Akasha standards  
• system expansion through controlled construction  

Forge acts as the **factory layer** of the ecosystem.

---

## Role in the Akasha Ecosystem

akasha-axioms → governing principles  
akasha-world → canonical knowledge registry  
akasha-discovery → proposes hypotheses and needs  
akasha-forge → constructs tools and modules  
akasha-constellation → maps and registers the ecosystem  

In simple terms:

discovery asks questions  
forge builds the tools to answer them

---

## Construction Flow

akasha-world → knowledge context  
↓  
akasha-discovery → identifies gap or need  
↓  
human steward → approves construction  
↓  
akasha-forge → generates module or repository  
↓  
akasha-constellation → registers the new system component  

Forge always operates under **human-in-the-loop approval**.

---

## Responsibilities

Forge may create:

• new Akasha repositories  
• discovery tools  
• analysis modules  
• experimental frameworks  
• system utilities  

All generated structures must conform to:

• Akasha axioms  
• repository naming conventions  
• ecosystem registry rules  

---

## Relationship to Other Repositories

akasha-axioms — defines the governing rules of the system  
akasha-world — provides knowledge context  
akasha-discovery — identifies what should be built  
akasha-constellation — records the structure of the ecosystem  

Forge expands the system, but never governs it.

---

## Philosophy

Akasha is not a single tool.

It is an evolving research environment.

Forge exists so the ecosystem can **grow intentionally rather than chaotically**.

---

## Bootstrap Engine (Initial Implementation)

Akasha Forge now includes a minimal executable layer to receive and respond to Discovery output.

Location:

akasha-forge/engine/forge_stub.py

This module represents the first operational step of Forge. It does not yet generate full repositories. Instead, it translates Discovery hypotheses into structured build plans.

### Function

• accepts hypothesis output from akasha-discovery  
• generates a structured build plan  
• prepares repository and module scaffolding instructions  
• writes output to build_outputs/ as JSON  

This establishes the first working bridge between:

akasha-discovery → akasha-forge

### Current Behavior

The Forge stub performs:

hypothesis → build plan

It does not yet:

• generate full repositories  
• push to GitHub  
• enforce full schema validation  
• auto-integrate with constellation  

Those capabilities will be added incrementally.

### Example Output

```json
{
  "target": "time_crystal",
  "source_gap_score": 0.9,
  "recommended_action": "Create exploratory module for 'time_crystal'",
  "repo_candidate": "akasha-time-crystal",
  "files_to_create": [
    "README.md",
    "repo-manifest.yaml",
    "NOTES.md"
  ]
}
